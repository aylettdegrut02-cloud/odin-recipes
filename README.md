# odin-recipes
This project serves as a demonstration of the HTML knowledge I have acquired during the foundations course of the Odin Project. The project goal is to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page with links to recipes. This project visually will be basic as it serves to demonstrate my foundational understanding of HTML.In the future I will be using CSS to add a more fleshed out visual interface.
